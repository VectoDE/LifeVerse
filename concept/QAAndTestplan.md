QA and Test Plan for LifeVerse

1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
LifeVerse is an open-world life simulator that includes both single-player and multiplayer elements. The game simulates real life in a dynamic world influenced by the players. The QA and Test Plan aims to ensure that the game runs stably on all platforms, the gameplay mechanics are error-free, and the player experience is optimal both technically and content-wise.

1.2 Purpose of the Test Plan
The test plan aims to review all critical aspects of the game through a series of structured tests to ensure that the final product meets the desired quality standards. The tests will be conducted both manually and automatically, covering all phases of the game, from core mechanics to multiplayer interactions.

2. Testing Methods and Approaches
2.1 Types of Tests

Unit Tests: Testing individual functions or methods to ensure that game modules work as expected.
Integration Tests: Verifying the interaction between different game modules and components.
System Tests: Testing the entire system to ensure that all parts of the game work together.
Regression Tests: Ensuring that new changes or expansions do not negatively impact existing functionalities.
Acceptance Tests (User Acceptance Testing - UAT): Tests performed by a selected group of users to validate the usability and fulfillment of the game’s requirements.
Performance Tests: Testing the performance of the game under various conditions, especially with high load and multiple simultaneous players in multiplayer mode.
Security Tests: Checking the security mechanisms, particularly regarding data security and multiplayer environment integrity.
Multiplayer Tests: Testing network connection, latency, synchronization, and player interactions in multiplayer mode.
2.2 Testing Tools

Automated Test Frameworks: Tools like Selenium, Appium, or Jest for unit and integration tests.
Load Testing Tools: Tools like Apache JMeter or LoadRunner for testing performance under heavy load.
Network Simulation Tools: Tools like WANem to simulate different network conditions and check synchronization in multiplayer.
Bug Tracking Systems: Tools like JIRA or Bugzilla to document and track discovered bugs and issues.
3. Test Scope
3.1 Gameplay Mechanics

Movement and Controls: Testing whether players can navigate the world smoothly in all environments (open world, city, buildings, etc.).
Interactions: Verifying that all interactions (trading, communication, quests) trigger correctly.
NPC Interactions: Ensuring that NPCs respond correctly to player actions and their behavior is aligned with the player world’s progress.
Events and Quests: Ensuring that quests start, are completed, and dynamically impact the world.
Economy System: Verifying the functionality of resource management, trade, and economic transactions between players.
3.2 Multiplayer Mechanics

Network Stability: Testing how well the game performs under different network conditions (LAN, WiFi, high latency, unstable connections).
World Synchronization: Ensuring that all players have the same world view and actions in real-time.
Multiplayer Interactions: Verifying that players can interact successfully (trading, communication, combat, quests).
Server Performance: Conducting stress tests to verify performance under high player numbers and large data transfers.
Cross-Platform Gameplay: Ensuring that players on different platforms (PC, consoles, VR) can play together without technical issues.
3.3 User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

Usability: Verifying that the UI is intuitive and players can easily access all important functions.
Responsiveness: Testing if the UI works well on different screen sizes and resolutions (PC, console, mobile devices).
Accessibility: Ensuring that the game is accessible to players with disabilities (e.g., color blindness, text-to-speech functionality).
3.4 Security and Privacy

Data Encryption: Verifying that all personal and gameplay progress data is securely transmitted and stored.
Account Security: Testing login, authentication, and password management systems for vulnerabilities.
Cheat Prevention: Ensuring that the anti-cheat system works correctly and players cannot cheat.
4. Test Phases
4.1 Alpha Test Phase

Goal: Identify and fix bugs in the core mechanics.
Duration: 4-6 weeks
Scope: Testing of core systems (movement, interactions, quests) across all platforms.
Testing: Unit tests and manual testing of core functions, environments, and interactions.
Target Audience: Internal QA team and close tester group.
4.2 Beta Test Phase

Goal: Involve a larger test group, test multiplayer mechanics, performance, and security.
Duration: 6-8 weeks
Scope: Comprehensive tests covering all areas of the game.
Testing: Multiplayer tests, UI/UX tests, load tests, and regression tests.
Target Audience: External testers (players), focus groups, and community.
4.3 Pre-Release Test Phase

Goal: Final verification of game quality, performance, and stability.
Duration: 2-4 weeks
Scope: End-to-end testing of the entire game.
Testing: Stress tests, security tests, and final acceptance tests.
Target Audience: External beta testers, community testers, and influencers.
4.4 Post-Release Test Phase

Goal: Identify and fix issues post-launch.
Duration: Ongoing after release.
Scope: Monitoring player experiences and quickly addressing bugs or server problems.
Testing: Bug fixes and patch tests, network adjustments, continuous performance monitoring, and player feedback.
5. Success Metrics
5.1 Bug Fixing and Bug Tracking

All critical bugs must be fixed within 48 hours.
All bugs should be documented in a bug tracking system.
The bug rate in Alpha and Beta should be under 5% of the tested features.
5.2 Performance Metrics

Game load times should be under 10 seconds on all platforms.
Multiplayer synchronization should have a maximum latency of 100ms between players.
Servers should remain stable with 500+ players without significant performance degradation.
5.3 User Experience

UI/UX tests should achieve a user satisfaction rate of over 85%.
The error rate for multiplayer interactions should be under 2% of total interactions.
6. Conclusion
This QA and test plan ensures that LifeVerse is not only functional and stable but also meets the highest quality standards. The plan covers all relevant aspects of the game, including gameplay, multiplayer, UI/UX, and security, and ensures that the final product receives positive feedback from both testers and players.
