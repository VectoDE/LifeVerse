## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in LifeVerse, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open an issue or discussion publicly**. This could allow malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability before it's fixed.
2. **Report the issue privately** by sending an email to [security@lifeverse.com](mailto:security@lifeverse.com). 
3. **Provide details** of the vulnerability, including:
   - The specific version of LifeVerse you tested.
   - The steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any potential risks or impact if the vulnerability is exploited.
   - Recommended fixes (if applicable).

We will prioritize and respond to security reports as quickly as possible.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow a **responsible disclosure process**:

- **Initial acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours.
- **Evaluation**: The LifeVerse security team will evaluate the report and determine the severity.
- **Fix and patch release**: We will create a fix and release it in a timely manner, depending on the severity.
- **Public disclosure**: After the patch is released, we will disclose the vulnerability publicly (without sensitive details) in our repositoryâ€™s Security tab.

## Secure Development Practices

LifeVerse follows secure development practices to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities:

- **Regular updates and patching**: We keep all dependencies up to date to mitigate security risks.
- **Code reviews**: Every piece of code, including external contributions, is reviewed by multiple developers.
- **Security audits**: We periodically perform internal and external security audits to identify potential risks.
- **Secure coding guidelines**: Our team follows secure coding guidelines to prevent common security issues such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and others.

## Security Features

LifeVerse includes the following security features to protect users:

- **Data encryption**: All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) is encrypted in transit using TLS.
- **Authentication**: We use secure authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to protect user accounts and data.
- **Access control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to ensure that users only have access to the data and functionality they are authorized for.
- **Rate limiting and input validation**: These measures are in place to prevent abuse, such as brute-force attacks and SQL injection.
