# Security Policy

LifeVerse is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our platform and customer data. This document describes the policies and processes that govern how we secure the product, collaborate with the security community, and respond to potential weaknesses. The policy is intended for enterprise customers, security researchers, and internal stakeholders.

## Scope

This policy applies to all LifeVerse services, APIs, mobile and web applications, infrastructure, and supporting components managed by the LifeVerse engineering organization. Third-party services are in-scope when they are integrated as part of a LifeVerse offering and operated under LifeVerse configuration.

## Supported Versions

LifeVerse maintains security coverage for the following release lines:

| Version Line | Support Level | Security Updates | End of Life (EoL) Policy |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **v1.0.x**   | General Availability | Critical and high severity fixes, monthly cumulative updates | 12 months after the next GA major release |
| **v1.1.x**   | Early Access / Beta  | Best-effort critical fixes | Upgrade to latest GA release within 90 days of GA announcement |

Security updates are delivered through hotfix releases and included in quarterly cumulative releases. Customers should ensure automated deployment pipelines stay current with the latest supported patch version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure and welcome collaboration from the security community. To report a vulnerability:

1. **Do not disclose publicly.** Please refrain from creating public GitHub issues, forum posts, or social media notifications.
2. **Submit a private report** to [security@lifeverse.com](mailto:security@lifeverse.com). For sensitive reports you may encrypt your message with our PGP key (`0x7F6D0A1B`).
3. **Include detailed information** to help us triage effectively:
   - Product area, build version, and deployment environment (e.g., SaaS, on-premises, container image).
   - Step-by-step reproduction instructions, exploit code (if available), and observed versus expected behavior.
   - Potential business impact, data exposure, and any relevant log excerpts or packet captures.
   - Suggested mitigations or patches when known.
4. **Indicate disclosure timelines** if you plan to publish your findings so we can coordinate responsibly.

LifeVerse will acknowledge receipt of your report within **24 business hours** and will provide a case identifier for future correspondence. Communications are handled by the Security Response Team (SRT).

## Vulnerability Triage and Disclosure Process

We follow a structured process aligned with industry standards (ISO/IEC 29147 and 30111):

1. **Acknowledgment & Initial Assessment** (≤24 hours): Confirm receipt, validate scope, and assign severity using CVSS v3.1 scoring.
2. **Investigation & Remediation Plan** (≤5 business days for critical/high findings): Reproduce the issue, assess impact, and determine remediation or compensating controls. For medium/low findings, remediation timelines are defined during release planning.
3. **Fix Implementation & Verification**: Engineering teams implement fixes following secure coding practices, peer review, and automated/static analysis validation. Patches undergo regression testing in staging environments.
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Once remediation is available, we coordinate a disclosure timeline with the reporter. Public advisories are published in the repository Security tab and via customer bulletins. Credit is granted with consent.

### Target Remediation SLAs

| Severity (CVSS v3.1) | Target Fix Availability | Deployment Expectation |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Critical (9.0–10.0)  | Fix or mitigation within 72 hours | Immediate deployment or emergency change window |
| High (7.0–8.9)       | Fix within 10 business days | Deploy in next scheduled maintenance window |
| Medium (4.0–6.9)     | Fix in next quarterly release | Deploy per customer change policy |
| Low (0.1–3.9)        | Fix as part of roadmap backlog | Deploy with standard release cadence |

If a vulnerability requires customer action, we will provide prescriptive guidance, configuration changes, or temporary mitigations.

## Safe Harbor

LifeVerse will not pursue legal action against security researchers acting in good faith and in accordance with this policy. Activities should avoid privacy violations, service degradation, and data exfiltration beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability. If uncertainty arises, contact us before proceeding.

## Secure Development Lifecycle

LifeVerse operates a Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) integrated with our engineering processes:

- **Threat Modeling**: Product teams perform threat modeling during design reviews, with a focus on authentication, authorization, and data flows.
- **Secure Coding Standards**: Engineers adhere to secure coding checklists covering input validation, cryptography, dependency management, and OWASP Top 10 categories.
- **Automated Security Testing**: CI pipelines enforce static application security testing (SAST), software composition analysis (SCA), secret scanning, and infrastructure-as-code policy checks.
- **Manual Reviews & Audits**: Every change undergoes peer code review. High-risk components receive periodic manual penetration testing by internal or third-party assessors.
- **Dependency Governance**: Dependencies are managed with automated alerts for known vulnerabilities (e.g., via GitHub Dependabot, Snyk). Critical libraries have defined upgrade playbooks.

## Infrastructure and Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Data in transit is protected with TLS 1.2+ and mutual TLS for service-to-service communication. Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 with centralized key management and key rotation policies.
- **Identity & Access Management**: Least-privilege access is enforced through role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, and periodic entitlement reviews.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Security information and event management (SIEM) captures audit logs, authentication events, and anomaly detection signals. Logs are retained per compliance requirements.
- **Incident Response**: The Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) operates a 24/7 on-call rotation, performs incident playbook drills quarterly, and communicates with customers per contractual obligations.
- **Business Continuity**: Disaster recovery plans include geographically distributed backups, quarterly restore testing, and RPO/RTO objectives aligned with enterprise SLAs.

## Customer Responsibilities

Enterprise customers share responsibility for securing their environments. Customers should:

- Apply security patches within the recommended timelines and monitor vendor advisories.
- Configure LifeVerse according to the [Hardening Guide](docs/hardening/README.md) and enforce strong identity practices.
- Ensure integrations and customizations comply with internal security policies and regulatory obligations.
- Report suspected account compromise or data exposure immediately to the SIRT.
