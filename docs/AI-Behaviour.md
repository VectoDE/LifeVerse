## Executive Summary
The AI Behaviour stack orchestrates believable agency, systemic decision-making, and adaptive
difficulty across LifeVerse. It balances computational efficiency with emergent behaviour so the
world feels alive and responsive.

## Scope & Boundaries
Covers perception, planning, behaviour trees, data pipelines, and toolchains driving AI Behaviour.

## Strategic Objectives
- Integrate player feedback loops to calibrate trust and fairness around AI Behaviour.
- Expose debugging overlays and developer affordances for AI Behaviour.
- Standardise architecture patterns that scale AI Behaviour across open-world densities.
- Govern ethical, accessibility, and performance constraints for AI Behaviour.

## Capability Highlights
- Capture test scenarios proving AI Behaviour handles the behaviour dimension, cross-play, and accessibility requirements.
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting AI Behaviour to the behaviour dimension and adjacent capabilities.
- Describe how player personas navigate AI Behaviour, highlighting artificial intelligence orchestration and the behaviour dimension variations across platforms.
- Document edge cases, fallback states, and live-ops toggles that keep AI Behaviour resilient when artificial intelligence orchestration is stressed.

## System Architecture & Components
- Align AI Behaviour update cadences with server deployment and live-ops schedules.
- Coordinate AI Behaviour data contracts with gameplay, animation, and network teams.
- Share behaviour metrics with analytics to monitor difficulty curves for AI Behaviour.
- Collaborate with narrative and economy stakeholders for AI Behaviour influenced content.

## Delivery Workflow
- Run profiling sweeps ensuring AI Behaviour meets frame budget targets.
- Maintain simulation sandboxes and behaviour debugging sessions for AI Behaviour.
- Document heuristics, parameters, and machine learning datasets powering AI Behaviour.
- Conduct pre-release tuning labs and player empathy reviews focused on AI Behaviour.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Player sentiment toward fairness, challenge, and authenticity of AI Behaviour.
- Performance, CPU/GPU utilisation, and network cost for AI Behaviour actors.
- Defect density, crash rates, and stability metrics across AI Behaviour releases.
- Telemetry validating behavioural diversity and script coverage for AI Behaviour.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Resource contention may limit scale or concurrency for AI Behaviour.
- Edge cases or training bias can create immersion-breaking outcomes in AI Behaviour.
- Insufficient authoring tools slow iteration on AI Behaviour behaviours.
- Security exploits might leverage AI Behaviour deterministic patterns.

## Roadmap & Expansion
- Layer adaptive difficulty, social simulation, and co-operative behaviours into AI Behaviour.
- Deliver baseline agent behaviours and authoring tools for AI Behaviour.
- Explore ML-driven personalisation, predictive scheduling, and automation for AI Behaviour.
- Invest in long-term research partnerships expanding AI Behaviour capabilities.

## Tooling & Automation
- Load-testing rigs, synthetic data generators, and replay tools validating AI Behaviour.
- Behaviour editors, state visualisers, and telemetry dashboards dedicated to AI Behaviour.
- Knowledge bases and onboarding guides for engineers integrating with AI Behaviour.
- Automated QA scenarios covering AI regression suites for AI Behaviour.
