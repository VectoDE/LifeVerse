## Executive Summary
The Emotional and Psychological System framework models systemic layers—weather, ecology, physics,
and socio-economic signals—that make LifeVerse dynamic. It gives players a world that reacts
consistently to their decisions while leaving room for emergent storytelling.

## Scope & Boundaries
Includes environmental modelling, physics solvers, data orchestration, and optimisation for
Emotional and Psychological System.

## Strategic Objectives
- Connect Emotional and Psychological System outputs to AI, narrative, and economy levers.
- Design fail-safes and override tooling to keep Emotional and Psychological System balanced for live events.
- Incorporate accessibility and performance accommodations within Emotional and Psychological System.
- Author scientific baselines, heuristics, and runtime constraints guiding Emotional and Psychological System.

## Capability Highlights
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting Emotional and Psychological System to system stack and adjacent capabilities.
- Capture test scenarios proving Emotional and Psychological System handles system stack, cross-play, and accessibility requirements.
- Describe how player personas navigate Emotional and Psychological System, highlighting emotional engagement arcs and emotional state models variations across platforms.
- Detail how Emotional and Psychological System links emotional engagement arcs with broader systemic simulation systems to create consistent player expectations.
