## Executive Summary
The Shader Development craft defines LifeVerse's visual language, world identity, and production
workflows. It balances fidelity, performance, and artistic cohesion across every environment and
asset.

## Scope & Boundaries
Includes concept art, modelling, texturing, lighting, animation, and style guides for Shader
Development.

## Strategic Objectives
- Document cultural, accessibility, and localisation considerations for Shader Development.
- Establish content pipelines, review cadences, and quality bars for Shader Development.
- Integrate art tooling, shaders, and engine features supporting Shader Development.
- Set aesthetic pillars and mood boards guiding Shader Development.

## Capability Highlights
- Capture test scenarios proving Shader Development handles the development dimension, cross-play, and accessibility requirements.
- Describe how player personas navigate Shader Development, highlighting shader engineering and the development dimension variations across platforms.
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting Shader Development to the development dimension and adjacent capabilities.
- Detail how Shader Development links shader engineering with broader art production systems to create consistent player expectations.

## System Architecture & Components
- Provide marketing and community teams with renders and breakdowns of Shader Development.
- Share asset libraries, metadata, and naming conventions for Shader Development.
- Align with audio, VFX, and UI to build cohesive experiences within Shader Development.
- Coordinate Shader Development with narrative, gameplay, and performance budgets.

## Delivery Workflow
- Publish postmortems and retrospectives to evolve Shader Development pipelines.
- Execute optimisation passes ensuring Shader Development meets platform budgets.
- Maintain asset trackers, shot lists, and outsourcing briefs for Shader Development.
- Run look-dev reviews, dailies, and art approvals covering Shader Development.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Player and stakeholder sentiment toward visuals within Shader Development.
- Brand consistency and art direction adherence measured for Shader Development.
- Performance metrics such as draw calls and memory footprint associated with Shader Development.
- Content throughput, review turnaround, and defect rates for Shader Development.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Evolving platform requirements may invalidate Shader Development assumptions.
- Outsourcing or vendor misalignment might break cohesion in Shader Development.
- Performance constraints could force rework for Shader Development.
