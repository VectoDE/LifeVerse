# AI Pathfinding Guide for LifeVerse Game

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing AI pathfinding in the LifeVerse game. Pathfinding is crucial for NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to navigate the game world effectively and realistically. In this guide, we will cover the key concepts, techniques, and best practices for setting up and optimizing AI pathfinding using Unreal Engine 5's built-in tools and systems.

## 2. Pathfinding Basics
AI pathfinding refers to the process of determining an optimal route for an NPC to travel from one point to another in the game world. Unreal Engine 5 provides a robust navigation system that allows AI to find paths around obstacles and terrains.

The core components of pathfinding in Unreal Engine 5 include:
- **NavMesh (Navigation Mesh)**: A representation of the walkable areas in the game world. The NavMesh is generated automatically from the level geometry.
- **NavAgent**: The AI entity that is tasked with navigating the game world using the NavMesh.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Unreal Engine uses the A* (A-star) algorithm by default for pathfinding.

## 3. Setting Up Navigation in Unreal Engine 5

### 3.1. Navigation Mesh (NavMesh)
To enable AI pathfinding, the first step is to ensure that a Navigation Mesh (NavMesh) exists in the game world. The NavMesh defines the areas where AI can move, and it is automatically generated based on the geometry of the level.

#### Steps:
1. **Place a NavMeshBoundsVolume**: In Unreal Engine, the `NavMeshBoundsVolume` defines the area within which the navigation mesh will be generated. Drag and drop the `NavMeshBoundsVolume` from the Place Actors panel into the level.
2. **Scale the Volume**: Resize the `NavMeshBoundsVolume` to encompass the areas you want the AI to be able to navigate.
3. **Rebuild the Navigation Data**: After placing the `NavMeshBoundsVolume`, navigate to the "Build" menu in the toolbar and select "Build Navigation" to generate the navigation mesh for the level.
4. **Visualize the NavMesh**: To visualize the NavMesh, go to the "Show" menu in the viewport and enable "Navigation". This will display the walkable areas in green.

### 3.2. NavMesh Settings
You can adjust the properties of the NavMesh to fine-tune the pathfinding behavior, such as:
- **Agent Radius**: The radius of the AI's navigation agent.
- **Agent Height**: The height of the AI's navigation agent.
- **Agent Max Slope**: The maximum slope the AI can walk on.
- **Agent Step Height**: The maximum step height the AI can climb.

These settings are available in the `Project Settings` under the "Navigation" section.

## 4. AI Pathfinding with Behavior Trees
Unreal Engine 5 allows you to use **Behavior Trees** in combination with AI pathfinding to create complex decision-making systems for NPCs.

### 4.1. Setting Up a Behavior Tree for Pathfinding
1. **Create an AI Controller**: The AI Controller manages the behavior of an AI-controlled character. To create an AI Controller:
   - Right-click in the Content Browser, go to `Blueprint Class`, and choose `AIController`.
   - Name it (e.g., `BP_AIController`).
2. **Create a Behavior Tree**: The Behavior Tree defines the AI's logic. To create a Behavior Tree:
   - Right-click in the Content Browser, go to `Artificial Intelligence`, and select `Behavior Tree`.
   - Name it (e.g., `BT_Pathfinding`).
3. **Create a Blackboard**: The Blackboard stores information used by the Behavior Tree. To create a Blackboard:
   - Right-click in the Content Browser, go to `Artificial Intelligence`, and select `Blackboard`.
   - Name it (e.g., `BB_Pathfinding`).
4. **Set Up Pathfinding Tasks in the Behavior Tree**:
   - Add a `Move To` node in the Behavior Tree, which will direct the AI to move towards a target location.
   - Link the target location to a `Vector` Blackboard key.
   - Ensure the `Move To` node is connected to the root of the tree to ensure it is executed.

### 4.2. Using Pathfinding in AI Logic
- In the AI Controller, use the `AIMoveTo` function to make the AI move towards a location.
- You can also use the `SimpleMoveToLocation` function for simpler movement logic.

Example in C++:

```cpp
// In AIController subclass
void AMyAIController::MoveToTarget(FVector TargetLocation)
{
    UNavigationSystemV1* NavSystem = UNavigationSystemV1::GetCurrent(GetWorld());
    if (NavSystem)
    {
        FNavLocation NavLocation;
        if (NavSystem->GetRandomReachablePointInRadius(TargetLocation, 1000.0f, NavLocation))
        {
            MoveToLocation(NavLocation.Location);
        }
    }
}

5. Pathfinding Obstacles and Avoidance

5.1. Dynamic Obstacles

To handle dynamic obstacles (e.g., moving objects), Unreal Engine supports Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance. AI can dynamically adjust their path when encountering obstacles in the environment.
	•	NavModifiers: These are used to modify the behavior of the NavMesh dynamically at runtime. You can use NavModifier volumes to block or modify paths.
	•	Collision with Actors: Ensure that actors and objects in the world have proper collision settings that interact with the NavMesh.

5.2. Pathfinding Avoidance System

Unreal Engine provides an AI Pathfinding Avoidance System that helps NPCs avoid obstacles and other AI agents. The system works by checking potential collisions and adjusting the path in real-time to avoid them.

5.3. Path Smoothing

After a path is found, it might contain sharp corners or inefficient routes. You can apply path smoothing to make the path more natural and efficient. This can be done by adjusting the AI’s pathfinding settings to ensure smoother paths or by using custom algorithms to adjust the path.

6. Performance Optimization for Pathfinding

6.1. Navigation Mesh Optimization
	•	NavMesh Resolution: Adjust the resolution of the NavMesh to optimize for performance. High-resolution meshes require more processing power, so consider using lower resolution for large, open areas.
	•	NavMesh Baking Frequency: Only bake the NavMesh when necessary. Rebuilding the NavMesh frequently during gameplay can cause performance drops.

6.2. Pathfinding Efficiency
	•	Path Caching: Cache previously computed paths to avoid recalculating the same path repeatedly.
	•	Pathfinding Frequency: Update pathfinding calculations at a fixed frequency instead of constantly updating every frame.

7. Debugging Pathfinding

Unreal Engine provides built-in tools to debug pathfinding and AI behavior:
	•	Navigation Visualization: Enable NavMesh visualization to see the walkable areas and the pathfinding results.
	•	AI Debugging: Use the AI Debugging tools (Show Debug AI) to visualize the AI’s movement and decision-making process during gameplay.

8. Conclusion

AI pathfinding is a critical component in creating intelligent and responsive NPCs in the LifeVerse game. By leveraging Unreal Engine 5’s built-in navigation and pathfinding systems, along with Behavior Trees and AI Controllers, you can create complex and dynamic pathfinding behaviors. Always remember to optimize pathfinding calculations for performance and to handle dynamic obstacles effectively.

This guide provides the foundation for implementing AI pathfinding, and you can extend it based on the specific needs and challenges of your game world.
