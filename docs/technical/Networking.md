# Networking Guide for LifeVerse Game

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the networking strategy for the LifeVerse game, developed using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). The focus is on enabling smooth multiplayer experiences, server-client communication, and efficient synchronization of game data across all players. The architecture should support scalability, low latency, and reliability in real-time interactions.

## 2. Networking Architecture Overview
The multiplayer networking architecture for LifeVerse will be based on Unreal Engine's built-in networking framework, which leverages the client-server model. This model ensures that one instance of the game (the server) is responsible for authoritative logic, while clients communicate with the server to update game state and receive information.

### Key Components:
- **Server**: The authoritative entity that manages the game world state, handles player input validation, and enforces rules.
- **Client**: The instance of the game running on a player's machine. It sends player actions to the server and receives updates to the game state.
- **Replication**: Unreal Engine uses a system called replication to ensure that all clients have synchronized data (such as positions, animations, and health values).

## 3. Networking Models
There are several networking models available within Unreal Engine, each suited to different use cases:

### 3.1. Client-Server Model
- **Primary Setup**: One dedicated server instance handles all game logic, while clients connect to this server. The server is authoritative, meaning it has control over the game world and all decisions are validated by it.
- **Client Responsibilities**: Clients send player inputs to the server and receive updates to game data (e.g., positions, states).
- **Server Responsibilities**: The server handles gameplay logic, collision detection, AI, and more. It also broadcasts updates to all clients to keep them synchronized.

### 3.2. Peer-to-Peer Model
- **Alternative Setup**: Each player (peer) communicates directly with others, with one player designated as the host.
- **Drawbacks**: This model may be susceptible to cheating and a less secure game environment. It is not recommended for large-scale multiplayer games.

### 3.3. Hybrid Model (Matchmaking and Dedicated Servers)
- A hybrid model will be used in LifeVerse, where players connect to a dedicated server after being matched via a matchmaking system. This model ensures authoritative control over game state and allows for scalability.

## 4. Key Networking Concepts

### 4.1. Replication
Replication is the process of synchronizing data across multiple clients. Unreal Engine provides an advanced replication system that automatically synchronizes properties and function calls between the server and clients.

- **Replicating Variables**: Properties that need to be shared between the server and client are marked with `UPROPERTY(Replicated)`. These variables will automatically sync during gameplay.
- **Replicating Functions**: Functions that need to be called on both the server and client are marked with `UFUNCTION(Server)` or `UFUNCTION(Client)`. Server-side functions are called on the server, while client-side functions execute on the client.

### 4.2. Network Updates and Latency
- **Tick Rate**: The rate at which the server updates and replicates game state to clients. A higher tick rate means more frequent updates but requires more processing power.
- **Latency Compensation**: Unreal Engine uses techniques like client-side prediction and server reconciliation to handle latency and improve gameplay responsiveness.
  - **Client-side Prediction**: Clients predict the outcome of their actions locally, allowing for smoother movement and quicker responses.
  - **Server Reconciliation**: The server corrects any discrepancies that may arise due to latency, ensuring that all clients are synchronized.

### 4.3. Bandwidth Optimization
Efficient bandwidth usage is crucial for ensuring a smooth multiplayer experience. This can be achieved by:
- **Prioritizing Updates**: Only essential game data (e.g., player positions, health) is replicated at a high frequency, while less critical data (e.g., NPC positions) can be updated less frequently.
- **Compressing Data**: Large data such as textures and world data should be compressed to reduce bandwidth usage during transmission.

## 5. Server and Client Communication

### 5.1. Reliable vs. Unreliable RPCs
- **Reliable RPCs**: Functions that must be executed, such as player actions or game state changes. These are sent with a guarantee of delivery.
  - Example: `UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable)`
- **Unreliable RPCs**: Functions where the server doesn’t require confirmation that the message was received. These are typically used for data that is not critical.
  - Example: `UFUNCTION(Client, Unreliable)`

### 5.2. Server RPCs
Server RPCs are functions that are executed on the server when called by the client. These functions are essential for validating actions like moving or interacting with objects in the game world.

- **Example**: A server-side function to move a player:
  ```cpp
  UFUNCTION(Server, Reliable, WithValidation)
  void Server_MovePlayer(FVector NewLocation);

5.3. Client RPCs

Client RPCs are functions that are called by the server and executed on the client. These are typically used for visual updates such as animations or effects that should be seen by the player.
	•	Example: A client-side function to show a particle effect:

UFUNCTION(Client, Reliable)
void Client_ShowEffect(FVector Location);



6. Networked Game Logic

6.1. Synchronizing Player States

Players in the game must have synchronized states (health, position, inventory). Unreal Engine’s networking framework ensures that this data is replicated across clients.
	•	Player Movement: Movement data is synchronized by replicating the position and velocity of each player’s character.
	•	Player Health: The player’s health is replicated to all clients so that each player sees the correct health status.

6.2. AI and NPC Behavior
	•	AI on Server: AI decisions and behaviors are processed on the server, while only the results (such as NPC positions and actions) are replicated to clients.
	•	NPC Interaction: NPCs can interact with players by sending replicated messages, which are then processed on the server and shown to the client.

6.3. Game Events

Important game events (such as player death, item pickups, or environment changes) should be replicated and handled by both the server and clients. These events are typically sent as custom event structures that are then broadcast to all connected players.

7. Matchmaking and Session Management

LifeVerse will include a matchmaking system to ensure players are matched with others based on skill level, region, and preferences.
	•	Dedicated Servers: Once players are matched, a dedicated server instance will be created for the match.
	•	Lobby System: Players will join a lobby before the match begins. This lobby will handle synchronization of player data (e.g., character selections, inventory) and provide a countdown before the game starts.

8. Security and Anti-Cheat Measures
	•	Server Authority: The server will be the authoritative source for all critical game data (such as player positions and interactions). Clients cannot directly alter game-critical information.
	•	Server-side Validation: All player inputs will be validated on the server before any changes are made to the game state.
	•	Cheat Detection: The server will constantly monitor for unusual behavior, such as abnormal movement speeds or impossible actions, and will take action against cheaters (e.g., kicking or banning players).

9. Testing and Debugging
	•	Network Profiler: Unreal Engine provides a network profiler tool that allows developers to measure network performance, identify bottlenecks, and debug synchronization issues.
	•	Simulating Latency: The engine allows developers to simulate network latency to test how the game behaves under various network conditions (e.g., high latency, packet loss).

10. Conclusion

The networking architecture for LifeVerse is designed to provide a seamless, scalable, and secure multiplayer experience for players. By utilizing Unreal Engine’s powerful networking tools and best practices, we can ensure that game data is synchronized across clients efficiently, with low latency and high reliability. The use of dedicated servers, replication, and anti-cheat mechanisms will provide a smooth and fair experience for all players.
