# Coding Standards for LifeVerse Game (C++)

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the coding standards for the LifeVerse game, developed using C++. Following these standards ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase, making collaboration easier for all developers.

## 2. General Guidelines

- **Code Structure**: 
  - Code should be organized into well-defined classes and functions.
  - Each class should have a single responsibility, adhering to the SOLID principles.
  - Avoid code duplication. If a logic is used in multiple places, consider creating a reusable function or class.
  
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - **Classes**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerCharacter`, `GameManager`).
  - **Variables**: Use camelCase (e.g., `playerHealth`, `maxSpeed`).
  - **Constants**: Use all uppercase letters with underscores (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`, `GRAVITY_FORCE`).
  - **Functions/Methods**: Use camelCase (e.g., `initializePlayer()`, `loadResources()`).
  - **Enums**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `GameModeType`, `PlayerState`).

- **File Organization**:
  - Header files (`.h`) should only contain class declarations and necessary includes.
  - Source files (`.cpp`) should contain implementation code.
  - Avoid putting logic in header files to prevent multiple definitions during compilation.

## 3. Commenting and Documentation

- **Class and Function Documentation**:
  - Every class should have a comment describing its purpose and usage.
  - Functions should have a comment above them that explains what they do, their input parameters, and the return value.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    // Updates the player's health based on damage taken
    // @param damage - The amount of damage to apply
    // @return The new health value
    int updateHealth(int damage);
    ```

- **Inline Comments**:
  - Use inline comments sparingly and only when the code is not self-explanatory.
  - Place comments above complex or non-obvious logic to clarify its intent.

- **TODO and FIXME**:
  - Use `TODO` to indicate tasks or improvements that need to be made later.
  - Use `FIXME` for areas of the code that need fixing or refactoring.

## 4. Code Formatting

- **Indentation**:
  - Use 4 spaces for indentation (do not use tabs).
  
- **Line Length**:
  - Limit lines to 100 characters for better readability.
  
- **Braces**:
  - Always use braces (`{}`) for control structures, even for single-line blocks.
  - Example:
    ```cpp
    if (condition) {
        // do something
    }
    ```

- **Blank Lines**:
  - Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code and improve readability.

## 5. Error Handling and Exceptions

- Use exceptions for unexpected errors or abnormal conditions that cannot be handled locally.
- For recoverable conditions, use error codes or result objects (e.g., `std::optional`, `std::variant`).
  
Example of error handling using exceptions:
```cpp
if (!file.open()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to open file.");
}

6. Memory Management
	•	Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) to manage resources, ensuring that memory is automatically cleaned up.
	•	Prefer std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr for automatic memory management over raw pointers.
	•	Manual memory management with new and delete should be avoided wherever possible.

Example using std::unique_ptr:

std::unique_ptr<PlayerCharacter> player = std::make_unique<PlayerCharacter>();

7. Performance Considerations
	•	Avoid unnecessary memory allocations in performance-critical sections of the code.
	•	Profile the code regularly to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.
	•	Use const whenever possible for variables that do not change to improve optimization.

8. Concurrency
	•	Use std::mutex and std::lock_guard to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded environments.
	•	Avoid using global variables for shared state in multi-threaded code.
	•	Prefer high-level constructs such as std::async for tasks that can run concurrently.

Example of thread-safe operation:

std::mutex mtx;
void safeFunction() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    // thread-safe code
}

9. Testing and Debugging
	•	Unit Tests: Write unit tests for all functions and classes that have non-trivial logic.
	•	Test Coverage: Ensure high test coverage, particularly for critical systems (e.g., AI, combat, physics).
	•	Use assert for conditions that should never fail during normal execution.

10. Code Reviews
	•	All code should undergo a peer review process before merging into the main branch.
	•	Code reviews should focus on code quality, readability, and adherence to the coding standards.
	•	Avoid merging large changes in a single pull request; break them down into smaller, manageable pieces.

11. Tools and IDE Setup
	•	Compiler: Use the latest version of the C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later.
	•	Static Analysis Tools: Use static analysis tools like Clang-Tidy to ensure code quality.
	•	Linters: Use a C++ linter to enforce coding style and standards.

12. Conclusion

By adhering to these coding standards, we ensure that LifeVerse is developed with a consistent and maintainable codebase, allowing for smoother collaboration, faster development cycles, and a higher-quality product.

For any questions or clarifications regarding these standards, please refer to the lead developer or team lead.

Damit wird eine einheitliche Struktur für die gesamte Codebasis geschaffen und erleichtert die Zusammenarbeit im Team.
