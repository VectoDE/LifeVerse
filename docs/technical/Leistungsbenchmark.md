# Performance Benchmark Guide for LifeVerse Game

## 1. Introduction
Performance benchmarking is crucial to ensure that the LifeVerse game runs smoothly across various hardware configurations. Unreal Engine 5 provides a robust set of tools to analyze and optimize performance. This guide outlines how to set up performance benchmarks, test various game features, and analyze the results to improve the overall performance of the game.

## 2. Performance Metrics to Track
When benchmarking the game, it is important to focus on key performance metrics. These metrics help identify performance bottlenecks and determine areas of improvement.

### 2.1. Frame Rate (FPS)
- **Target FPS**: Ensure that the game runs at a smooth frame rate (usually 60 FPS or higher) to provide a seamless experience.
- **Minimum FPS**: Track the lowest FPS recorded during gameplay to identify any performance dips.

### 2.2. CPU and GPU Utilization
- **CPU Usage**: Measure the percentage of CPU utilization during gameplay. High CPU usage could indicate inefficient code or too many concurrent processes.
- **GPU Usage**: Monitor the GPU usage to ensure that the rendering pipeline is not bottlenecked by the graphics card.

### 2.3. Memory Usage
- **RAM Usage**: Track the amount of memory used by the game. High memory usage can cause crashes or slowdowns, especially on lower-end hardware.
- **VRAM Usage**: Monitor video memory usage to ensure the game does not exceed the available VRAM on the graphics card.

### 2.4. Load Times
- **Initial Load Time**: Measure the time it takes for the game to start up and reach the main menu.
- **Level Load Time**: Track how long it takes to load new levels or game environments.

### 2.5. Input Lag
- **Latency**: Measure the input latency to ensure there is no noticeable delay between pressing a button and seeing the response on screen.

## 3. Benchmarking Setup

### 3.1. Unreal Engine 5 Profiler
Unreal Engine provides several tools for profiling the performance of the game. The primary tool for this is the **Unreal Engine Profiler**. It collects real-time data about the game’s performance and displays it in various graphs.

1. **Enable the Profiler**:
   - Open the **Editor Preferences** and enable the **Profiler** under the **Performance** tab.
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to start profiling in the editor.

2. **Capture Performance Data**:
   - Use the **Stat Unit** command to display frame time and performance data during gameplay. This can be executed in the console.
     ```
     Stat Unit
     ```

3. **Analyze the Profiler Output**:
   - The profiler displays detailed data on CPU and GPU usage, memory consumption, and more. Use this information to identify any performance bottlenecks.

### 3.2. Setting Up Custom Benchmark Scenes
Creating dedicated benchmark scenes is essential for obtaining consistent performance measurements. These scenes should focus on specific game systems like AI, physics, rendering, or environmental interactions.

- **Minimal Scene**: Create a scene with a minimal environment, a few objects, and no active gameplay elements. This serves as a baseline for the performance tests.
- **Stress Test Scene**: Design a scene with high object counts, complex physics, and a variety of active AI agents. This helps simulate worst-case performance scenarios.
- **Complex Scene**: Create a large, open-world environment with many assets, including NPCs, vehicles, and dynamic systems, to test real-world performance.

### 3.3. Automating Benchmarks
Automating benchmark tests allows you to easily compare performance across multiple runs. You can use Unreal's command-line options to run the game without loading the editor and automatically log performance data.

- **Command-Line Arguments**:

YourGame.exe -benchmark -log=performance_log.txt

- **Performance Logging**:
 - You can log performance data into a text file using Unreal’s built-in logging system. This can be helpful for tracking and comparing benchmarks over time.

## 4. Analyzing Benchmark Results

### 4.1. Identifying Bottlenecks
Once performance data is captured, the next step is to analyze it and identify any bottlenecks that could hinder performance. Focus on the following areas:

- **CPU Usage**:
 - If the CPU usage is consistently high, this may indicate heavy computations, poor multi-threading, or inefficient algorithms.
 - Analyze the **Stat CPU** profiler to see which processes are using the most CPU time.

- **GPU Usage**:
 - High GPU usage could indicate that the rendering pipeline is too complex or that too many assets are being drawn in each frame.
 - Use **Stat GPU** to get detailed breakdowns of the GPU workload.

- **Memory Usage**:
 - Monitor both **RAM** and **VRAM** to ensure the game does not exceed available memory.
 - Use **Stat Memory** to track memory allocations during gameplay and identify potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage.

- **Load Times**:
 - Use **Stat Gameplay** to track level loading times and identify any assets or scripts causing delays during level transition.

### 4.2. Profiling Key Game Features
Focus your benchmarking efforts on specific features that are critical to game performance:

- **AI Performance**: Use **Stat AI** to monitor the performance of AI agents and behaviors. If AI is consuming too many resources, consider optimizing pathfinding algorithms or reducing the number of active NPCs at any given time.

- **Physics Performance**: Physics simulations can be resource-heavy, especially for complex interactions. Use **Stat Physics** to track physics updates and ensure they are not overloading the CPU.

- **Rendering Performance**: Use **Stat SceneRendering** to monitor the performance of the rendering pipeline. Look for areas that can be optimized, such as texture sizes, draw calls, and shader complexity.

### 4.3. Reducing Performance Bottlenecks
After identifying the bottlenecks, the next step is optimization. Here are some strategies:

- **Optimization of AI**:
 - Use **AI LODs** (Level of Detail) to reduce the complexity of AI calculations for distant NPCs.
 - Use **NavMesh** optimization to streamline pathfinding.

- **Physics Optimization**:
 - Use **collision simplification** (e.g., boxes, spheres) instead of complex meshes for physics calculations.
 - Lower the **physics simulation frequency** for non-critical objects.

- **Rendering Optimization**:
 - Implement **culling** to avoid rendering objects that are not visible.
 - Reduce **shadow quality** and **draw distance** for large, open-world environments.

- **Memory Optimization**:
 - Use **asset streaming** to load assets only when needed.
 - Optimize texture and mesh sizes to reduce memory consumption.

## 5. Benchmarking for Different Platforms
Performance can vary widely across different platforms, so it is essential to test the game on various hardware configurations to ensure broad compatibility.

- **PC**: Test on a range of configurations from low-end to high-end machines. Ensure that the game runs well on a variety of GPUs and CPUs.
- **Consoles**: Benchmark on target consoles (PlayStation, Xbox) and use the platform-specific tools provided by Unreal Engine to profile performance.
- **Mobile**: If targeting mobile platforms, test performance on a range of devices and focus on optimizing CPU, GPU, and memory usage.

## 6. Reporting Benchmark Results
Once you have collected the performance data, it is essential to report and document the results clearly. This report should include:

- The hardware configuration used for testing (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.).
- The benchmark scene or test case used.
- The key performance metrics (FPS, CPU/GPU usage, memory usage, etc.).
- A comparison of results over multiple runs or across different hardware configurations.
- Suggested optimizations or changes based on the findings.

## 7. Conclusion
Performance benchmarking is an essential part of game development that ensures the game runs smoothly across different platforms and hardware configurations. By utilizing Unreal Engine 5's profiling tools and following best practices for benchmarking, you can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the game for better performance. Regular benchmarking throughout the development process helps maintain performance standards and ensures a smooth gameplay experience for players.

This guide provides the foundation for setting up and conducting performance benchmarks, but it can be expanded with additional testing as the game evolves.
