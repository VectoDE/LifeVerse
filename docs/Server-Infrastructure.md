## Executive Summary
The Server Infrastructure stack delivers resilient, low-latency services that keep LifeVerse always
available. It balances scalability, observability, and cost efficiency to support millions of
concurrent players.

## Scope & Boundaries
Includes cloud architecture, networking, deployment automation, observability, and live operations
workflows for Server Infrastructure.

## Strategic Objectives
- Automate provisioning, testing, and blue/green deploys for Server Infrastructure.
- Instrument full-stack monitoring and alerting covering Server Infrastructure.
- Integrate FinOps practices to optimise cost profiles for Server Infrastructure.
- Design highly-available topologies and redundancy models underpinning Server Infrastructure.

## Capability Highlights
- Document edge cases, fallback states, and live-ops toggles that keep Server Infrastructure resilient when server architecture is stressed.
- Describe how player personas navigate Server Infrastructure, highlighting server architecture and the infrastructure dimension variations across platforms.
- Outline knowledge-sharing cadences so improvements to Server Infrastructure uplift neighbouring online services initiatives.
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting Server Infrastructure to the infrastructure dimension and adjacent capabilities.

## System Architecture & Components
- Collaborate with data engineering to capture operational telemetry from Server Infrastructure.
- Align with product and marketing calendars when scaling Server Infrastructure capacity.
- Connect Server Infrastructure pipelines with CI/CD, security scanning, and change management gates.
- Share service-level objectives and runbooks with support teams for Server Infrastructure.

## Delivery Workflow
- Operate on-call rotations and runbooks to support Server Infrastructure 24/7.
- Document incident retrospectives and root-cause analyses tied to Server Infrastructure.
- Maintain infrastructure-as-code repositories describing Server Infrastructure.
- Run chaos engineering, load tests, and failover drills for Server Infrastructure.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Customer impact metrics for outages or degradation in Server Infrastructure.
- Cost efficiency and resource utilisation insights for Server Infrastructure.
- Availability, latency, error rates, and scalability metrics for Server Infrastructure.
- MTTR, MTBF, and change failure rates associated with Server Infrastructure.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Vendor dependency or supply chain issues threaten Server Infrastructure delivery.
- Insufficient observability hinders detection of issues within Server Infrastructure.
- Unpatched vulnerabilities or misconfiguration could compromise Server Infrastructure.
- Capacity misalignment may cause outages during major Server Infrastructure events.

## Roadmap & Expansion
- Integrate predictive scaling and self-healing capabilities into Server Infrastructure.
- Adopt edge computing, serverless, and container orchestration innovations for Server Infrastructure.
- Stabilise baseline environments and SLOs for Server Infrastructure.
- Automate elasticity, regional expansion, and hybrid deployments enhancing Server Infrastructure.

## Tooling & Automation
- Security scanning and compliance automation integrated with Server Infrastructure.
- Cost dashboards, capacity planners, and vendor management trackers for Server Infrastructure.
- Infrastructure-as-code templates, observability stacks, and deployment pipelines for Server Infrastructure.
- Incident management platforms, pager rotations, and runbook libraries covering Server Infrastructure.
