# Material and Shader Guide for LifeVerse Game

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide on materials and shaders used in the LifeVerse game. Materials and shaders are essential for creating visually appealing and realistic environments, characters, and objects. This guide outlines the structure, naming conventions, usage, and optimization strategies for materials and shaders.

## 2. Overview of Material Types
In Unreal Engine 5, materials are composed of shaders that define the appearance of surfaces. The following are the key material types used in LifeVerse:

- **Base Materials**: Standard materials for static objects, terrain, and characters.
- **Special Effects Materials**: Materials for specific effects like fire, water, and particle systems.
- **Character Materials**: Materials designed for characters, including skin, hair, and clothing.
- **Environmental Materials**: Materials for dynamic environmental objects, such as water, terrain, and foliage.
- **UI Materials**: Materials used for UI elements and HUD display.

## 3. Naming Conventions
To maintain consistency and readability, the following naming conventions are used for materials and shaders:

- **Prefix**: Use a specific prefix to define the type of material:
  - `M_` for materials (e.g., `M_Ground`, `M_Wood`)
  - `MS_` for material shaders (e.g., `MS_ShinySurface`, `MS_Skin`)
  - `MF_` for material functions (e.g., `MF_DirtMask`, `MF_Fog`)
- **Descriptive Names**: Names should describe the material's purpose or effect.
- **Suffixes**: Use suffixes to specify material types or variations:
  - `_Base` for basic versions (e.g., `M_Wood_Base`)
  - `_Detail` for detailed or variant materials (e.g., `M_Wood_Detail`)
  - `_Wet` for wet versions of materials (e.g., `M_Ground_Wet`)

## 4. Material Editor Setup
Unreal Engine's Material Editor is used to create and edit materials using nodes to define the properties of the material. The main components in the Material Editor include:

- **Base Color**: Defines the base color of the material. Use textures or constant values.
- **Metallic**: Controls whether the material behaves like a metal (value between 0 and 1).
- **Specular**: Adjusts the specular reflection strength (0 for non-metallic materials).
- **Roughness**: Determines how smooth or rough the surface appears.
- **Normal Map**: Adds surface detail for a more realistic effect without adding geometry.
- **Opacity**: Controls transparency for materials that need to be see-through (e.g., glass or water).
- **Emissive**: Allows materials to emit light, useful for glowing effects.

### Example: Basic Material for Wood
```text
Material: M_Wood_Base
- Base Color: Wood Texture
- Roughness: 0.5
- Metallic: 0.0
- Normal Map: Wood Grain Normal Map
- Opacity: 1.0 (non-transparent)

Example: Shiny Metal Material

Material: M_Metal_Shiny
- Base Color: Metal Texture
- Roughness: 0.2 (smooth)
- Metallic: 1.0 (full metallic)
- Specular: 0.5
- Normal Map: Metal Surface Detail Normal Map

5. Material Shaders

Shaders in Unreal Engine control how materials are rendered. Some common types of shaders include:
	•	Surface Shaders: Control the basic look of materials on static and dynamic surfaces.
	•	Post-Processing Shaders: Modify the final image after it has been rendered to achieve visual effects such as bloom, vignette, or motion blur.
	•	Vertex Shaders: Modify vertex attributes for animation or special effects.
	•	Compute Shaders: Handle tasks such as image processing or physics simulations.

Example: Custom Shader for Wet Surface

A custom shader can be created to simulate the effect of wet surfaces.

Shader: MS_WetSurface
- Input: Base Material (e.g., M_Ground)
- Effect: Adds a wetness effect by blending a wetness texture with the base material.
- Features:
  - Reflection increase based on wetness amount.
  - Slightly higher roughness and metallic properties when wet.

6. Material Functions

Material functions are reusable nodes or node groups that can be plugged into materials to streamline the creation process. They help reduce duplication and make material creation more efficient.

Example: Dirt Mask Function

A material function that defines a mask for dirt buildup on a surface.

Function: MF_DirtMask
- Input: Surface curvature, world position
- Output: A mask that blends dirt texture onto a surface based on curvature.

7. Optimization Techniques

Optimization is essential to maintain performance, especially for large open-world games. Here are some best practices for material and shader optimization:
	•	Use Material Instances: Instead of creating new materials, use material instances to adjust parameters without duplicating materials.
	•	Minimize Texture Samplers: Limit the number of textures used in each material to reduce GPU load.
	•	Avoid Expensive Operations: Avoid using expensive operations such as sin(), cos(), and high-cost texture sampling in shaders.
	•	LOD (Level of Detail): Use lower-resolution textures and simplified materials for distant objects.
	•	Bake Effects: For static elements, bake lighting and effects into the textures (lightmaps, ambient occlusion maps) instead of calculating them in real-time.
	•	Use Simple Shaders for Non-Detailed Objects: Use simpler shaders for small or background objects that don’t require complex visual effects.

8. Special Effects Materials

For special effects like fire, smoke, or water, use custom shaders and materials. These materials often use advanced techniques like particle systems and dynamic textures.

Example: Fire Effect Material

Material: M_Fire
- Base Color: Flame Texture
- Emissive: Strong to make the fire glow
- Opacity: Use a texture with a transparent background
- Normal Map: Simulates movement of flames
- Use particle system to control fire movement

Example: Water Material

Material: M_Water
- Base Color: Water Texture
- Opacity: Transparent, with variable opacity based on depth
- Refraction: Adds realistic water distortion
- Specular: High to simulate water reflections
- Normal Map: Simulates water waves
- Fresnel Effect: Used to make edges of the water more reflective

9. Conclusion

Materials and shaders are key components in creating visually engaging environments and objects in LifeVerse. This guide provides a framework for how to structure, name, and optimize materials and shaders for different assets within the game. Following these best practices will help ensure a consistent and performant visual experience across all platforms.
