## Executive Summary
The Networking stack delivers resilient, low-latency services that keep LifeVerse always available.
It balances scalability, observability, and cost efficiency to support millions of concurrent
players.

## Scope & Boundaries
Includes cloud architecture, networking, deployment automation, observability, and live operations
workflows for Networking.

## Strategic Objectives
- Instrument full-stack monitoring and alerting covering Networking.
- Document disaster recovery, capacity planning, and compliance requirements for Networking.
- Integrate FinOps practices to optimise cost profiles for Networking.
- Automate provisioning, testing, and blue/green deploys for Networking.

## Capability Highlights
- Outline knowledge-sharing cadences so improvements to Networking uplift neighbouring online services initiatives.
- Detail how Networking links networking protocols with broader online services systems to create consistent player expectations.
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting Networking to networking protocols and adjacent capabilities.
- Define authoring guidelines and content taxonomies ensuring every networking protocols within Networking remains discoverable.

## System Architecture & Components
- Connect Networking pipelines with CI/CD, security scanning, and change management gates.
- Share service-level objectives and runbooks with support teams for Networking.
- Align with product and marketing calendars when scaling Networking capacity.
- Collaborate with data engineering to capture operational telemetry from Networking.

## Delivery Workflow
- Maintain infrastructure-as-code repositories describing Networking.
- Run chaos engineering, load tests, and failover drills for Networking.
- Document incident retrospectives and root-cause analyses tied to Networking.
- Operate on-call rotations and runbooks to support Networking 24/7.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Availability, latency, error rates, and scalability metrics for Networking.
- MTTR, MTBF, and change failure rates associated with Networking.
- Cost efficiency and resource utilisation insights for Networking.
- Customer impact metrics for outages or degradation in Networking.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Unpatched vulnerabilities or misconfiguration could compromise Networking.
- Capacity misalignment may cause outages during major Networking events.
- Insufficient observability hinders detection of issues within Networking.
- Vendor dependency or supply chain issues threaten Networking delivery.

## Roadmap & Expansion
- Stabilise baseline environments and SLOs for Networking.
- Automate elasticity, regional expansion, and hybrid deployments enhancing Networking.
- Adopt edge computing, serverless, and container orchestration innovations for Networking.
- Integrate predictive scaling and self-healing capabilities into Networking.

## Tooling & Automation
- Infrastructure-as-code templates, observability stacks, and deployment pipelines for Networking.
- Incident management platforms, pager rotations, and runbook libraries covering Networking.
- Cost dashboards, capacity planners, and vendor management trackers for Networking.
- Security scanning and compliance automation integrated with Networking.
