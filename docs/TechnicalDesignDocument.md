Technical Design Document (TDD) for LifeVerse
1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
Game Title: LifeVerse
Genre: Open-World Life Simulation, RPG, Multiplayer
Objective: Development of a realistic, open-world life simulator with a dynamic story and multiplayer integration, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to deliver an exceptional gaming experience.
1.2 Technical Requirements
Platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, Cloud Gaming, VR/AR
Game Engine: Unreal Engine 5
Database: MongoDB or similar databases for player progression and world changes storage
Server: Highly scalable server infrastructure to support millions of concurrent players in a persistent world
Goal: To develop a stable, scalable, modular, and high-performance architecture.
2. Technical Architecture
2.1 Game Engine: Unreal Engine 5
Rendering: Raytracing and Nanite for photorealistic graphics and detail.
Physics: Chaos Physics for realistic destruction and vehicle movements.
Artificial Intelligence: Implementation of advanced AI using Unreal's Behavior Trees and Utility AI.
Cloud Integration: Utilizing cloud services to store and manage the game world (especially for persistent worlds and large data sets).
2.2 Server Architecture
Database: MongoDB for storing player and game world data.
Distributed Architecture: Multiple server clusters to manage data across various geographical locations and ensure high availability.
Persistence: The game world is persistent, meaning player actions (e.g., economy, cities, world events) are stored and visible to all players.
2.3 Network Technology
Peer-to-Peer & Server-Client Model: Multiplayer will be implemented in a hybrid model, where a dedicated server manages the central world and peer-to-peer connections are used for specific activities.
Matchmaking System: The game will feature a robust matchmaking system that pairs players based on their progress and interests.
3. Data Management and Persistence
3.1 Game World Storage
All world changes (e.g., buildings, destroyed structures, economic changes) are stored in a central database.
MongoDB provides flexible storage for a persistent world where every player interaction and world change is tracked and processed.
3.2 Player Progression and Synchronization
Player progression (e.g., career, relationships, finances) is regularly saved using snapshots in the database.
Distributed Caching (e.g., Redis) is utilized for fast synchronization of player progress across multiple servers.
4. Gameplay Systems
4.1 Life Simulation Engine
Jobs and Activities: Players can perform various jobs, with each job having its own subsystem to simulate tasks, rewards, and interactions.
Social Interactions: A system to manage relationships and interactions where each NPC entity has its own "relationship score," which changes over time.
Economic System: A deep economic system managing various professions, trade, real estate, and investments.
4.2 AI System
NPC Behavior: NPCs have various goals such as work, leisure, or personal interests. These goals change depending on the situation and the player's interaction.
Behavior Trees: Use of behavior trees for managing NPC decisions, such as how they react to the player's actions.
Emotional AI: Each NPC reacts emotionally to the player, which can build or destroy relationships.
4.3 Dynamic World
Procedural Generation: Parts of the world (e.g., roads, buildings, side characters) are procedurally generated to enable infinite variety in interactions.
Real-Time Changes: The game includes systems for real-time management of time of day, weather, seasons, and societal events that affect the world and NPCs.
5. Multiplayer and Online Integration
5.1 Multiplayer Mode
Cooperative and Competitive: Players can cooperate to achieve shared goals or compete against each other.
Global Persistence: The entire world is persistent, and all players share the same world. All actions performed by a player (e.g., destruction, building structures, economic activities) are immediately visible and impact other players.
5.2 Connection and Network Latency
Low-Latency System: Network communication is optimized to minimize latency and improve the gameplay experience.
Regional Servers: Geographically distributed servers to minimize latency and ensure stable connections.
6. User Interface (UI) and Interaction Systems
6.1 HUD (Head-Up Display)
Simple and intuitive user interface that works in both traditional and VR modes.
Interactive menus and HUD: Customizable HUD elements to help the player quickly access different aspects of the simulation (e.g., career, relationships, finances).
6.2 VR Integration
Full Immersion: Customization of the user interface for Virtual Reality (VR), with gesture-based controls and the ability to interact with the world (e.g., touching objects, having conversations, performing actions).
7. Testing and Quality Assurance
7.1 Automated Testing
Regular automated tests for all critical gameplay elements, especially AI, multiplayer, and network stability.
Test Environments: A test environment will be created to cover all aspects of the game for continuous bug-fixing and performance optimization.
7.2 User Testing
Early user feedback loops, particularly for VR elements and multiplayer interactions, to enhance the user experience.
8. Security and Privacy Measures
8.1 Data Encryption
Use of end-to-end encryption for all sensitive player information.
Ensuring that no player data is transmitted unencrypted.
8.2 Protection Against Exploits
Continuous checks for exploits and protection against cheating to ensure a fair gameplay experience.
9. Performance and Optimization
9.1 Graphics Optimization
Level of Detail (LOD): Optimization of graphics for different distances to maximize performance on all platforms.
Streaming Methods: Use of streaming technologies to load large worlds in real-time without affecting performance.
9.2 Multiplayer Optimization
Dynamic Server Management: Dynamic allocation of servers based on player activity and distribution to ensure even performance.
10. Conclusion and Summary
The LifeVerse project will be technically demanding and complex, but with the right architecture and cutting-edge technologies, it will deliver a rich and immersive experience for players. By using Unreal Engine 5, advanced AI, and a scalable infrastructure, the game will run smoothly across all platforms and offer a massive, persistent world for millions of players.
