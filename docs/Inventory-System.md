## Executive Summary
The Inventory System capability defines how players pursue goals, respond to systemic feedback, and
experience challenge within LifeVerse. It keeps every loop readable, tunable, and rewarding across
solo play, co-op teams, and competitive scenarios.

## Scope & Boundaries
Covers mechanical rules, progression pacing, failure states, reward structures, and UX messaging
linked to Inventory System.

## Strategic Objectives
- Ensure Inventory System interacts gracefully with economy sinks, narrative beats, and live service events.
- Curate knowledge-sharing rituals keeping cross-discipline partners aligned on Inventory System updates.
- Codify the rules, data schemas, and behavioural models that make Inventory System compelling.
- Establish rapid iteration loops so insights from analytics continually refine Inventory System.

## Capability Highlights
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting Inventory System to system stack and adjacent capabilities.
- Outline knowledge-sharing cadences so improvements to Inventory System uplift neighbouring gameplay systems initiatives.
- Define authoring guidelines and content taxonomies ensuring every system stack within Inventory System remains discoverable.
- Capture test scenarios proving Inventory System handles system stack, cross-play, and accessibility requirements.

## System Architecture & Components
- Coordinate content drops and promotional beats that feature Inventory System moments.
- Expose telemetry hooks so analytics can observe funnel health for Inventory System.
- Share balancing cadences with community and support teams for Inventory System.
- Sync Inventory System with quest scripting, story arcs, and player onboarding flows.

## Delivery Workflow
- Host cross-discipline reviews validating art, engineering, QA, and publishing needs for Inventory System.
- Drive Jira epics, Miro boards, and Confluence specs describing Inventory System deliverables.
- Publish changelogs and regression plans for each Inventory System deployment.
- Prototype Inventory System in Unreal play spaces and document tuning outcomes.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Balancing adjustments confirmed through controlled experiments focusing on Inventory System.
- Player sentiment, survey verbatims, and qualitative research for Inventory System.
- Economic impact and retention deltas attributable to Inventory System.
- Engagement, win/loss rates, and abandon triggers tracked for Inventory System.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Insufficient automation increases regression risk when iterating on Inventory System.
- Content or tuning drift may undermine adjacent systems that depend on Inventory System.
- Scope creep could delay milestone beats tied to Inventory System.
- Mechanical complexity or unclear communication can overwhelm the audience for Inventory System.

## Roadmap & Expansion
