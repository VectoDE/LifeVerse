## 1. Overview
LifeVerse's game engine is designed to be highly modular, with different systems exposed via well-defined APIs. These APIs allow developers to create custom gameplay logic, modify existing systems, and interface with the engine at a low level for optimal performance.

## 2. Core API
The core API includes fundamental systems such as actors, components, and general utility functions used throughout the game.

### 2.1. Actor Class
The `AActor` class is the base class for all in-game objects, such as characters, items, and interactable objects.

#### Key Methods:
- **SpawnActor**: Spawns a new actor in the world.
    ```cpp
    AActor* SpawnActor(UClass* ActorClass, FVector Location, FRotator Rotation);
    ```
- **Destroy**: Destroys an actor in the game world.
    ```cpp
    void Destroy();
    ```
- **SetActorLocation**: Moves the actor to a specific location.
    ```cpp
    void SetActorLocation(FVector NewLocation);
    ```

### 2.2. Component Class
Components are attached to actors and define behaviors such as physics, rendering, and input handling.

#### Key Methods:
- **AttachToComponent**: Attaches a component to another component or actor.
    ```cpp
    void AttachToComponent(USceneComponent* ParentComponent, FAttachmentTransformRules AttachmentRules);
    ```
- **SetComponentVisibility**: Toggles the visibility of a component.
    ```cpp
    void SetComponentVisibility(bool bVisible);
    ```

## 3. Gameplay Systems API
This section covers gameplay-related systems, including player state, inventory management, and quest handling.

### 3.1. Player State API
The `APlayerState` class tracks information about the player, such as health, score, and inventory.

#### Key Methods:
- **GetHealth**: Retrieves the player's current health.
    ```cpp
    float GetHealth() const;
    ```
- **SetScore**: Sets the player's score.
    ```cpp
    void SetScore(int32 NewScore);
    ```

### 3.2. Inventory API
The `UInventoryComponent` class manages the player's inventory and item interactions.

#### Key Methods:
- **AddItem**: Adds an item to the inventory.
    ```cpp
    void AddItem(UItem* Item);
    ```
- **RemoveItem**: Removes an item from the inventory.
    ```cpp
    void RemoveItem(UItem* Item);
    ```

### 3.3. Quest System API
The `UQuestSystem` class allows you to create and manage quests.

#### Key Methods:
- **StartQuest**: Starts a new quest for the player.
    ```cpp
    void StartQuest(UQuest* Quest);
    ```
- **CompleteQuest**: Marks a quest as completed.
    ```cpp
    void CompleteQuest(UQuest* Quest);
    ```

## 4. Networking API
The networking API handles multiplayer gameplay, including server-client communication, replication, and player synchronization.

### 4.1. Networked Actor API
Actors that are replicated across the network need special handling.

#### Key Methods:
- **OnRep_Health**: Replicates the player's health across the network.
    ```cpp
    UFUNCTION()
    void OnRep_Health();
    ```
- **Multicast Method**: Calls a function on all clients in the network.
    ```cpp
    UFUNCTION(NetMulticast, Reliable)
    void Multicast_Example();
    ```

### 4.2. Player Sync API
Synchronizes player data across different clients.

#### Key Methods:
- **SyncPlayerPosition**: Synchronizes player position across all clients.
    ```cpp
    void SyncPlayerPosition(FVector Position);
    ```

## 5. AI and Pathfinding API
LifeVerse uses Unreal's powerful AI systems, including behavior trees, pathfinding, and decision-making.

### 5.1. AI Controller Class
The `AAIController` class controls AI agents in the world.

#### Key Methods:
- **MoveToLocation**: Commands the AI to move to a specified location.
    ```cpp
    void MoveToLocation(FVector Destination);
    ```
- **SetFocus**: Sets the AI's focus to an actor or location.
    ```cpp
    void SetFocus(AActor* TargetActor);
    ```

### 5.2. Pathfinding API
The pathfinding system uses Unreal's NavMesh to navigate the world.

#### Key Methods:
- **FindPathToLocation**: Finds a path from the AI to a target location.
    ```cpp
    FNavPath* FindPathToLocation(FVector TargetLocation);
    ```

## 6. Graphics and Rendering API
The graphics API provides methods for managing materials, shaders, and rendering objects.

### 6.1. Material API
Materials define how objects are rendered in the game world.

#### Key Methods:
- **SetBaseColor**: Sets the base color of a material.
    ```cpp
    void SetBaseColor(FLinearColor Color);
    ```

    ```cpp
    UMaterial* CreateShader(UShader* Shader);
    ```

## 7. Audio API
The audio API handles sound playback, volume control, and spatialization for the game.

### 7.1. Sound Cue API
The `USoundCue` class plays a sound in the game world.

#### Key Methods:
- **PlaySound**: Plays a specific sound cue at a location.
    ```cpp
    void PlaySound(USoundCue* SoundCue, FVector Location);
    ```

### 7.2. Audio Settings API
Manages global audio settings, such as volume and sound effects.

#### Key Methods:
- **SetMasterVolume**: Sets the global master volume.
    ```cpp
    void SetMasterVolume(float Volume);
    ```

## 8. Player Input API
The input API provides functionality for handling player inputs (e.g., keyboard, mouse, gamepad).

### 8.1. Input Binding
Input events are bound to specific functions or actions in the game.

#### Key Methods:
- **BindAction**: Binds an action input (e.g., "Jump") to a function.
    ```cpp
    void BindAction("Jump", IE_Pressed, this, &AMyCharacter::Jump);
    ```

## 9. Debugging and Logging API
LifeVerse provides extensive debugging and logging capabilities for troubleshooting during development.
