## 1. Support Channels

There are several ways players can contact the support team for assistance. It's important to provide clear instructions on where and how to submit issues.

- **Email Support**: Players can send emails to a dedicated support email address, such as `support@lifeverse.com`.
- **In-Game Support**: Players can submit support requests directly from within the game interface, which may include bug reports, technical problems, or account inquiries.
- **Live Chat**: Use live chat tools (such as Zendesk or Intercom) to provide real-time support during business hours.
- **Support Forum**: Set up a community-driven support forum where players can ask questions and discuss common issues.
- **Social Media**: Players can reach out through the official LifeVerse social media accounts for basic inquiries or concerns.
- **Help Center**: Provide an online knowledge base or FAQ section to allow players to find answers to common questions independently.

## 2. Support Tiers and Escalation

To effectively manage player inquiries, support should be organized into different tiers, each handling specific types of issues. The escalation process ensures that complex or critical issues are addressed promptly.

- **Tier 1: Basic Support**: Handle general inquiries, account issues, and technical difficulties that can be resolved with standard troubleshooting steps. This includes resetting passwords, checking server status, and answering basic game-related questions.
- **Tier 2: Intermediate Support**: Address issues that require more in-depth knowledge of the game mechanics or troubleshooting steps, such as bug fixes or game-related performance issues.
- **Tier 3: Advanced Support**: For critical issues that may require direct interaction with the development team, such as server outages, game-breaking bugs, or large-scale exploits. These issues should be escalated immediately for fast resolution.

### Escalation Process

- **Escalation Procedure**: If a support agent is unable to resolve an issue at their tier, it should be escalated to the next higher tier. This ensures that players’ concerns are addressed by individuals with more expertise or access to necessary resources.
- **Priority Levels**: Assign priority levels to issues (e.g., low, medium, high, critical) and use these to determine the speed at which each issue is handled.

## 3. Response Time Guidelines

Efficient response times are essential for maintaining player satisfaction. The following guidelines should be followed to ensure timely support:

- **Tier 1**: Respond within 24 hours of receiving a ticket or request.
- **Tier 2**: Provide an update or resolution within 48 hours of receiving the issue.
- **Tier 3**: Complex issues should be acknowledged within 24 hours, with regular updates on the resolution process, and the issue should be resolved within 72 hours.
- **Live Chat**: Response time should be within 1-2 minutes, with agents resolving issues in real-time.
- **Social Media**: Respond to general inquiries within 24 hours on all official channels.

## 4. Issue Resolution Process

The support team should follow a standard process for handling player issues, ensuring all tickets are properly tracked and resolved.

### Steps

1. **Ticket Creation**: Upon receiving an inquiry, create a support ticket with details about the issue and player’s contact information.
2. **Issue Identification**: Collect all relevant information about the issue (screenshots, error messages, account details, etc.).
3. **Troubleshooting**: Perform initial troubleshooting steps based on the information provided and the nature of the issue.
4. **Resolution**: Apply the necessary fix or solution, whether it’s providing guidance, escalating the issue, or applying a patch.
5. **Player Follow-Up**: After resolving the issue, follow up with the player to ensure satisfaction and confirm that the issue was resolved to their satisfaction.

## 5. Common Issues and Solutions

- **Account Recovery**: Provide guidance on recovering lost passwords, account bans, and hacked accounts.
