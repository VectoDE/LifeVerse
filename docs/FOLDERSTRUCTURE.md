Key Components of the Directory Structure:
	1.	Source/
	•	This folder holds the C++ code for the game. It includes both the core game logic and Unreal Engine-specific modules, divided into public and private components. You’ll find AI, character systems, combat mechanics, networking, and real estate-related code here.
	2.	Content/
	•	Contains all assets used within the game, such as art (models, textures, animations), audio (sound effects, voice recordings), maps (level designs), and UI elements. Blueprints are also stored here, enabling visual scripting within Unreal Engine.
	3.	Plugins/
	•	Houses any third-party tools or custom-built plugins. For example, you might store the MySQL plugin used to connect the game to the database in this folder.
	4.	Database/
	•	Holds the structure for your MySQL database, including tables for player data (progression, inventory), world state (NPCs, events), and transactions (in-game purchases).
	5.	Config/
	•	Stores configuration files for Unreal Engine, game settings, database connections, and input mappings for controls. It defines how the engine behaves and interacts with other systems, like the MySQL database.
	6.	Scripts/
	•	This folder contains any scripts that help automate parts of the development process, such as build scripts or deployment scripts.
	7.	Documentation/
	•	Includes essential documentation, such as the game design document, system designs (AI, combat, networking), and any post-mortem reports for evaluation after development cycles.
	8.	LifeVerse.uproject
	•	The main Unreal Engine 5 project file, which is used to open the project in the Unreal Engine editor.

This structure ensures that the project is well-organized for both development and collaboration, keeping each component isolated and modular, while maintaining a clear pathway for future expansion or updates.
