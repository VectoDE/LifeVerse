## Executive Summary
The Character Design craft defines LifeVerse's visual language, world identity, and production
workflows. It balances fidelity, performance, and artistic cohesion across every environment and
asset.

## Scope & Boundaries
Includes concept art, modelling, texturing, lighting, animation, and style guides for Character
Design.

## Strategic Objectives
- Integrate art tooling, shaders, and engine features supporting Character Design.
- Document cultural, accessibility, and localisation considerations for Character Design.
- Establish content pipelines, review cadences, and quality bars for Character Design.
- Foster collaboration between art, design, and engineering around Character Design.

## Capability Highlights
- Capture test scenarios proving Character Design handles design vision, cross-play, and accessibility requirements.
- Describe how player personas navigate Character Design, highlighting the character dimension and design vision variations across platforms.
- Define authoring guidelines and content taxonomies ensuring every design vision within Character Design remains discoverable.
- Document edge cases, fallback states, and live-ops toggles that keep Character Design resilient when the character dimension is stressed.

## System Architecture & Components
- Provide marketing and community teams with renders and breakdowns of Character Design.
- Share asset libraries, metadata, and naming conventions for Character Design.
- Coordinate Character Design with narrative, gameplay, and performance budgets.
- Align with audio, VFX, and UI to build cohesive experiences within Character Design.

## Delivery Workflow
- Publish postmortems and retrospectives to evolve Character Design pipelines.
- Execute optimisation passes ensuring Character Design meets platform budgets.
- Run look-dev reviews, dailies, and art approvals covering Character Design.
- Maintain asset trackers, shot lists, and outsourcing briefs for Character Design.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Player and stakeholder sentiment toward visuals within Character Design.
- Brand consistency and art direction adherence measured for Character Design.
- Content throughput, review turnaround, and defect rates for Character Design.
- Performance metrics such as draw calls and memory footprint associated with Character Design.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Evolving platform requirements may invalidate Character Design assumptions.
- Outsourcing or vendor misalignment might break cohesion in Character Design.
- Pipeline bottlenecks or asset debt may delay Character Design deliverables.
- Performance constraints could force rework for Character Design.

## Roadmap & Expansion
- Enable player customisation and mod support interfacing with Character Design.
- Introduce new rendering techniques, lighting models, and platform variants for Character Design.
- Ship hero assets, biomes, and style guides defining Character Design.
- Scale production with modular kits, procedural tools, and outsourcing for Character Design.

## Tooling & Automation
- Documentation archives and art bibles cataloguing Character Design.
- Performance analysis tools, build farm automation, and LOD generators for Character Design.
- DCC integrations, shader libraries, and asset management supporting Character Design.
- Review platforms, annotation tools, and QA workflows for Character Design.
