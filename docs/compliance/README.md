## Purpose
This document summarises the regulatory frameworks, certification objectives, and
operational controls that govern LifeVerse's compliance posture. It aligns security,
privacy, and operational requirements across global jurisdictions.

## Regulatory Landscape
| Framework | Applicability | Primary Obligations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GDPR** | EU/EEA players and data subjects | Lawful processing, consent tracking, data subject rights, breach notification within 72 hours. |
| **CCPA/CPRA** | California residents | Do-not-sell controls, transparent notices, verified consumer requests, data inventory. |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Enterprise customers and partners | Security, availability, confidentiality controls with continuous monitoring evidence. |
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | Global operations | Information security management system (ISMS) governance, risk treatment plans, internal audits. |
| **PCI DSS SAQ A-EP** | Payment processing integrations | Network segmentation, vulnerability scanning, incident response, third-party management. |

## Governance Model
- **Compliance Steering Committee:** Quarterly review of control performance, audit
  findings, and remediation budgets.
- **Control Owners:** Named individuals for each policy area maintain runbooks and
  evidence artefacts.
- **Audit Management:** Dedicated team coordinates external assessors, maintains
  documentation repositories, and tracks remediation SLAs.

## Policies & Standards
- Enterprise policies stored in the internal Policy Portal with explicit versioning.
- Mandatory annual review cycles; emergency updates triggered by regulatory change.
- Policies mapped to control frameworks using a unified controls matrix.

## Control Execution
1. **Plan:** Assess changes to products or infrastructure via Compliance Impact
   Assessments (CIA) before implementation.
2. **Build:** Embed controls into infrastructure-as-code, CI pipelines, and service
   configuration baselines.
3. **Verify:** Capture automated evidence (logs, scan results, tickets) in the
   Compliance Data Lake; tag with control identifiers.
4. **Report:** Generate dashboard views for executives, auditors, and product teams.

## Evidence Management
- All artefacts stored in an immutable S3 bucket with object lock and access logging.
- Metadata schema captures control ID, owner, review date, and retention requirement.
- Quarterly self-assessments verify evidence freshness and control effectiveness.

## Audit Readiness Checklist
- ✅ Control matrix reviewed and signed off by control owners within last quarter.
- ✅ Incident response and disaster recovery tests executed with documented lessons learned.
- ✅ Penetration tests and vulnerability scans remediated within SLA windows.
- ✅ Vendor risk assessments completed for all critical third parties.
- ✅ Data protection impact assessments (DPIA) updated for new high-risk features.

## Training & Awareness
- Annual mandatory compliance training for all employees with ≥ 90% completion target.
- Role-specific briefings for engineers, customer support, and community teams.
- Monthly newsletters summarising policy updates, regulatory news, and key metrics.

## Continuous Improvement
- Capture findings from audits, incidents, and retrospectives into the Compliance
  Improvement Backlog.
- Prioritise actions based on risk scoring and report progress in steering committee meetings.
- Update this overview when new regulations, certifications, or regions are added.
