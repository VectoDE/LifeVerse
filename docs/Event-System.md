## Executive Summary
The Event System capability defines how players pursue goals, respond to systemic feedback, and
experience challenge within LifeVerse. It keeps every loop readable, tunable, and rewarding across
solo play, co-op teams, and competitive scenarios.

## Scope & Boundaries
Covers mechanical rules, progression pacing, failure states, reward structures, and UX messaging
linked to Event System.

## Strategic Objectives
- Curate knowledge-sharing rituals keeping cross-discipline partners aligned on Event System updates.
- Ensure Event System interacts gracefully with economy sinks, narrative beats, and live service events.
- Establish rapid iteration loops so insights from analytics continually refine Event System.
- Embed accessibility, monetisation, and community guardrails inside Event System specifications.

## Capability Highlights
- Capture test scenarios proving Event System handles system stack, cross-play, and accessibility requirements.
- Document edge cases, fallback states, and live-ops toggles that keep Event System resilient when event orchestration is stressed.
- Describe how player personas navigate Event System, highlighting event orchestration and system stack variations across platforms.
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting Event System to system stack and adjacent capabilities.

## System Architecture & Components
- Sync Event System with quest scripting, story arcs, and player onboarding flows.
- Coordinate content drops and promotional beats that feature Event System moments.
- Share balancing cadences with community and support teams for Event System.
- Expose telemetry hooks so analytics can observe funnel health for Event System.

## Delivery Workflow
- Prototype Event System in Unreal play spaces and document tuning outcomes.
- Host cross-discipline reviews validating art, engineering, QA, and publishing needs for Event System.
- Publish changelogs and regression plans for each Event System deployment.
- Drive Jira epics, Miro boards, and Confluence specs describing Event System deliverables.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Engagement, win/loss rates, and abandon triggers tracked for Event System.
- Balancing adjustments confirmed through controlled experiments focusing on Event System.
- Economic impact and retention deltas attributable to Event System.
- Player sentiment, survey verbatims, and qualitative research for Event System.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Mechanical complexity or unclear communication can overwhelm the audience for Event System.
- Insufficient automation increases regression risk when iterating on Event System.
- Scope creep could delay milestone beats tied to Event System.
- Content or tuning drift may undermine adjacent systems that depend on Event System.

## Roadmap & Expansion
- Deliver launch-ready foundations for Event System across core modes.
- Expand live-ops tooling, personalization, and cross-platform parity for Event System.
- Prototype experimental mechanics and evaluate whether they fold back into Event System.
- Introduce seasonal modifiers, narrative arcs, and social loops anchored in Event System.

## Tooling & Automation
- Balance dashboards, simulation sandboxes, and data validation tools for Event System.
- Automated tests covering rule sets, progression tables, and telemetry for Event System.
- Shared asset libraries and blueprint prefabs powering Event System.
- Design briefs, playtest scripts, and governance templates documenting Event System.
