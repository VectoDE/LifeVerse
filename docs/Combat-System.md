## Executive Summary
The Combat System capability defines how players pursue goals, respond to systemic feedback, and
experience challenge within LifeVerse. It keeps every loop readable, tunable, and rewarding across
solo play, co-op teams, and competitive scenarios.

## Scope & Boundaries
Covers mechanical rules, progression pacing, failure states, reward structures, and UX messaging
linked to Combat System.

## Strategic Objectives
- Establish rapid iteration loops so insights from analytics continually refine Combat System.
- Ensure Combat System interacts gracefully with economy sinks, narrative beats, and live service events.
- Codify the rules, data schemas, and behavioural models that make Combat System compelling.
- Curate knowledge-sharing rituals keeping cross-discipline partners aligned on Combat System updates.

## Capability Highlights
- Capture test scenarios proving Combat System handles system stack, cross-play, and accessibility requirements.
- Describe how player personas navigate Combat System, highlighting the combat dimension and system stack variations across platforms.
- Document edge cases, fallback states, and live-ops toggles that keep Combat System resilient when the combat dimension is stressed.
- Outline knowledge-sharing cadences so improvements to Combat System uplift neighbouring gameplay systems initiatives.

## System Architecture & Components
- Share balancing cadences with community and support teams for Combat System.
- Expose telemetry hooks so analytics can observe funnel health for Combat System.
- Coordinate content drops and promotional beats that feature Combat System moments.
- Sync Combat System with quest scripting, story arcs, and player onboarding flows.

## Delivery Workflow
- Publish changelogs and regression plans for each Combat System deployment.
- Drive Jira epics, Miro boards, and Confluence specs describing Combat System deliverables.
- Host cross-discipline reviews validating art, engineering, QA, and publishing needs for Combat System.
- Prototype Combat System in Unreal play spaces and document tuning outcomes.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Economic impact and retention deltas attributable to Combat System.
- Player sentiment, survey verbatims, and qualitative research for Combat System.
- Balancing adjustments confirmed through controlled experiments focusing on Combat System.
- Engagement, win/loss rates, and abandon triggers tracked for Combat System.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Scope creep could delay milestone beats tied to Combat System.
- Content or tuning drift may undermine adjacent systems that depend on Combat System.
- Insufficient automation increases regression risk when iterating on Combat System.
- Mechanical complexity or unclear communication can overwhelm the audience for Combat System.

## Roadmap & Expansion
- Prototype experimental mechanics and evaluate whether they fold back into Combat System.
- Introduce seasonal modifiers, narrative arcs, and social loops anchored in Combat System.
- Expand live-ops tooling, personalization, and cross-platform parity for Combat System.
- Deliver launch-ready foundations for Combat System across core modes.

## Tooling & Automation
- Shared asset libraries and blueprint prefabs powering Combat System.
- Design briefs, playtest scripts, and governance templates documenting Combat System.
- Automated tests covering rule sets, progression tables, and telemetry for Combat System.
- Balance dashboards, simulation sandboxes, and data validation tools for Combat System.
