## Executive Summary
The NPC Design stack orchestrates believable agency, systemic decision-making, and adaptive
difficulty across LifeVerse. It balances computational efficiency with emergent behaviour so the
world feels alive and responsive.

## Scope & Boundaries
Covers perception, planning, behaviour trees, data pipelines, and toolchains driving NPC Design.

## Strategic Objectives
- Blend authored logic with machine learning telemetry to evolve NPC Design over time.
- Expose debugging overlays and developer affordances for NPC Design.
- Standardise architecture patterns that scale NPC Design across open-world densities.
- Govern ethical, accessibility, and performance constraints for NPC Design.

## Capability Highlights
- Surface dependencies and escalation paths connecting NPC Design to design vision and adjacent capabilities.
- Document edge cases, fallback states, and live-ops toggles that keep NPC Design resilient when non-player character agency is stressed.
- Outline knowledge-sharing cadences so improvements to NPC Design uplift neighbouring intelligent systems initiatives.
- Describe how player personas navigate NPC Design, highlighting non-player character agency and design vision variations across platforms.

## System Architecture & Components
- Collaborate with narrative and economy stakeholders for NPC Design influenced content.
- Align NPC Design update cadences with server deployment and live-ops schedules.
- Coordinate NPC Design data contracts with gameplay, animation, and network teams.
- Share behaviour metrics with analytics to monitor difficulty curves for NPC Design.

## Delivery Workflow
- Conduct pre-release tuning labs and player empathy reviews focused on NPC Design.
- Run profiling sweeps ensuring NPC Design meets frame budget targets.
- Maintain simulation sandboxes and behaviour debugging sessions for NPC Design.
- Document heuristics, parameters, and machine learning datasets powering NPC Design.

## Telemetry & KPIs
- Telemetry validating behavioural diversity and script coverage for NPC Design.
- Player sentiment toward fairness, challenge, and authenticity of NPC Design.
- Performance, CPU/GPU utilisation, and network cost for NPC Design actors.
- Defect density, crash rates, and stability metrics across NPC Design releases.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Security exploits might leverage NPC Design deterministic patterns.
- Resource contention may limit scale or concurrency for NPC Design.
- Edge cases or training bias can create immersion-breaking outcomes in NPC Design.
- Insufficient authoring tools slow iteration on NPC Design behaviours.

## Roadmap & Expansion
- Invest in long-term research partnerships expanding NPC Design capabilities.
- Layer adaptive difficulty, social simulation, and co-operative behaviours into NPC Design.
- Deliver baseline agent behaviours and authoring tools for NPC Design.
- Explore ML-driven personalisation, predictive scheduling, and automation for NPC Design.

## Tooling & Automation
- Automated QA scenarios covering AI regression suites for NPC Design.
- Load-testing rigs, synthetic data generators, and replay tools validating NPC Design.
- Behaviour editors, state visualisers, and telemetry dashboards dedicated to NPC Design.
- Knowledge bases and onboarding guides for engineers integrating with NPC Design.
